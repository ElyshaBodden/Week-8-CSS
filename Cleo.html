    <h1>Meet Cleopatra a.k.a Cleo</h1>
<p class="headerimg"><img src="Cleo 1.JPG" alt="Pic of cleo. Black dog."></p>



<p>Cleo is 4 years old and weighs about 8.5 lbs.</p>
<p>She is a June baby. This makes her a gemini.</p>
<p>Though she is physically a dog, I like to think that she was a cat in a past life.</p>
<ul class="otherpg">
    <li>Only plays with cat toys</li> 
    <li>Likes her food cut in miniscule pieces</li> 
    <li>Lounges on the backs of couches</li>
    <li>Drinks out of fountains, faucets, or bath tubs</li> 
</ul>
<p>Cleo was not my first dog but she is my first psuedo child.</p>
